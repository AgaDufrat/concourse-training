# External tasks must specify the basis for their root filesystem - in this case
# as a Docker image. Elsewhere in the pipeline we’ve been passing an image asset
# to tasks. However, an external task can be run in isolation (not as part of a
# pipeline) so it can’t rely on an image being passed to it.
